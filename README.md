# Code-Refactor-Wk1-Code-BootCamp
The first homework assignment for the Coding BootCamp, to refactor a websites HTML and CSS code.

I have refactored this HTML file to use semantic tags, to have decreasing heading Tags, resolved a failed link, added missing class to the footer tag and added alt attributes to all images, including the hero image for accessibility.
